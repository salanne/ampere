Laura Scalfi is awarded the L'Oréal-Unesco Young Talent Prize (7/10/2021)
==========================================================================

She received this award for her PhD work dedicated to the influence of the metallic character of solid surfaces on the properties of confined and interfacial fluids. 

On this occasion, Sorbonne University issued a portrait of Laura on [its website](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/portraits/laura-scalfi).

`MetalWalls` is awarded the special prize Joseph Fourier 2021 by Atos and GENCI (8/7/2021)
==========================================================================================

The Atos – Joseph Fourier Prize aims at rewarding the work of researchers, academics and industrial scientists in three strategic areas: Advanced Computing (HPC, Quantum, Edge) & Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on Decarbonation. 

MetalWalls was selected in the advanced computing category, for its contribution to the simulation of energy storage systems.

The [Institut Universitaire de France](https://www.iufrance.fr/) (IUF), is a service of the French Ministry of Higher Education that distinguishes each year a small number of university professors for their research excellence, as evidenced by their international recognition.


Release of the `MetalWalls` software (29/05/2020)
=================================================

15 years after the first version of the code developed by Paul Madden and Stewart Reed, and after 6 years of development at the [Maison de la Simulation](https://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/en/maison-de-la-simulation/) and [PHENIX](https://www.phenix.cnrs.fr/) laboratories, the `MetalWalls` software has finally been released! 

`MetalWalls` is a molecular dynamics code dedicated to the modelling of electrochemical systems. Its main originality is the inclusion of a series of methods allowing to apply a constant potential within the electrode materials.

The code is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ampere2/metalwalls/). Details of the implemented force fields, thermodynamic ensembles and models, a description of the installation process and of input and output files, and guidelines for developers are provided in the [Wiki section](https://gitlab.com/ampere2/metalwalls/-/wikis/home) of the GitLab project.

A short manuscript describing the main originalities of `MetalWalls` is available :
